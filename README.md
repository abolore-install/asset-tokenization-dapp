## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity smart contract deployment tools

### Deployment

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain
2. Initialize compliance authority
3. Begin registering assets

### Usage Example

```clarity
;; Register a new asset
(contract-call? .asset-tokenization register-asset "REAL_ESTATE" "ipfs://..." u1000)

;; List asset for sale
(contract-call? .asset-tokenization list-asset u1 u100 u10 u1000)
```

## Security Considerations

- Access control mechanisms
- Balance validation
- Compliance checks
- Transaction safety measures

## Testing

Comprehensive testing should cover:

- Asset registration and management
- Token operations
- Marketplace functionality
- Compliance controls
- Error conditions
